This week, we were tasked to create an application called `just-tech-news`. This Express and MySQL application will be successful by completing the following:

- Implement the Sequelize ORM in a Node.js application.

- Define models that use datatype validations.

- Implement CRUD methods using Sequelize.

- Implement Sequelize associations to join one or more tables.


- Use the bcrypt package to hash password information and use environment variables to protect sensitive data.
